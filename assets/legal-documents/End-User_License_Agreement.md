    2.1. License to the Software. Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Wheelhouser grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the Software on a compatible device that you own or control. This license is granted free of charge and permits you to use the features of the Software that operate without connecting to Wheelhouser's paid services.
    2.2. Subscription to Services. Access to and use of certain features, functionality, and services ("Services") requires an active, paid subscription. These Services include, but are not limited to:
        a) Connectivity to and management of content on the Marquee-Magic Display Server.
        b) Integration with third-party social media platforms.
    The license to use these Services is granted only for the duration of your active subscription term. The terms of your subscription, including fees, billing cycles, and cancellation policies, are governed by the subscription agreement presented at the time of purchase.
    2.3. Scope of Use. This Agreement grants you a license to use the Software and subscribed-to Services; it does not transfer ownership. The Software and Services are licensed, not sold, to you. Wheelhouser reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement.

3. Restrictions on Use
    3.1. General Software Restrictions. Your license is subject to the following limitations. You are not permitted to, and you agree not to permit others to:

    3.2. Display Server and Embedded Software Restrictions. The Display Server is a hardware device provided by Wheelhouser which contains proprietary Embedded Software. Your purchase of the Display Server hardware does not grant you any ownership rights to the Embedded Software. In addition to the restrictions above, you agree that you shall not:

        b) Use the Display Server with any third-party management software or connect it to any cloud service not explicitly authorized by Wheelhouser.
        c) Tamper with, open the casing of, or attempt to physically repair the Display Server hardware. Any such action is undertaken at your own risk and will immediately void any hardware warranty and terminate your license to use the Services.
        d) Use the Display Server for any purpose after your subscription to the Services has lapsed or been terminated.

You must immediately stop all use of the Software and Services and destroy all copies of the Marquee-Magic Designer software.

Marquee-Magic Hardware Return and Refund Policy

At Marquee-Magic, we stand behind the quality of our products and want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If you are not satisfied, please review our policy below for returns and refunds.

1. General Return Window
You may return most new, unopened items in their original packaging within 30 days of delivery for a full refund.

2. Eligibility Conditions for Return
To be eligible for a return, your item must meet the following conditions:
Proof of Purchase: You must provide the original receipt or a valid proof of purchase (e.g., order number).
Condition: The hardware must be in its original, unused, and undamaged condition. All original components, accessories, manuals, and packaging must be included.
Opened Items: Opened items may be subject to inspection and a partial refund or denial of return if the product shows signs of use or damage.
Installed/Used Items: Once hardware is installed or has been used, it is generally considered non-returnable unless the return is due to a verifiable manufacturing defect (see Section 4: Defective or Damaged Items).

3. Non-Returnable Items
The following items are exceptions and cannot be returned or refunded:
Clearance/Final Sale Items: Products marked as "Final Sale" or "Clearance."
Custom Orders: Any items that were custom-configured, cut to size (e.g., wiring, tubing, rope), or specially ordered.
Consumables: Items like batteries, fluids, paints, or sealants that have been opened or used.
Missing or Altered Packaging: Items returned without original packaging or with damaged/altered UPC codes.

4. Defective or Damaged Items (Warranty Claims)
If your Marquee-Magic Hardware arrives damaged or is defective due to a manufacturing fault, we will gladly exchange it or provide a full refund.
Reporting: You must notify us of any damages or defects within 7 days of delivery.
Process: We will provide a pre-paid return shipping label. Upon inspection and verification of the defect, we will issue a full refund, including original shipping charges, or send a replacement unit. This does not cover damage caused by misuse, improper installation, or external factors.

5. The Return Process
To initiate a return, please follow these steps:
Request a Return: Contact our Customer Service team at sales@marquee-magic.com or call us at 302-506-2442 to request a Return Authorization (RA) number. Returns without a valid RA number may be refused.
Package the Item: Securely pack the item(s) in the original packaging, including all accessories and documentation, and clearly write the RA number on the outside of the box.
Ship the Return: Ship the package to the return address provided by Customer Service. For non-defective returns, the customer is responsible for all return shipping costs.

6. Refunds and Processing
Inspection: Once we receive your returned item, it will be inspected. We will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
Restocking Fee: A restocking fee of 15% may be deducted from your refund for non-defective returns that are accepted after being opened, or for special-order items.
Method: Approved refunds will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within 5 business days. Processing time may vary depending on your bank or credit card company.
Shipping Costs: Original shipping and handling charges are non-refundable unless the return is a result of our error or a defective product.
